# Innocell Bioreactor

The ‘InnoCell Bioreactor’ (IB) is a self-produced unit enabling enhanced Microbial Cellulose (MB) production and yield. The IB is an outcome of the interdisciplinary project InnoCell exploring the (g)local potential of Microbial Cellulose production and applications. The InnoCell Bioreactor is designed as a DIY module that could be scaled up or down according to needs and technological availability. As an innovative module, it fosters accelerated development of production models related to glocal production and interconnected systems.
