# Innocell Bioreactor

InnoCell envisions the future of glocal production by means of growing design to develop nutritious foods and materials through the fermentation of underused organic byproducts.

The project has three focus points, investing in the innovation potential of  SCOBY produced in terms of materials of semi finished materials (Halbzeuge / Semilavorato) -here below, enhancing SCOBY growth through the development of the ‘Innocell Bioreactor’, as well as ‘Innocell Products’ which is a future based vision into a more circular and biodegradable world of Cellulose based material world.

# Innocell Bioreactor

The ‘InnoCell Bioreactor’ (IB) is a self-produced unit enabling enhanced Microbial Cellulose (MB) production and yield. The IB is an outcome of the interdisciplinary project InnoCell exploring the (g)local potential of Microbial Cellulose production and applications. The InnoCell Bioreactor is designed as a DIY module that could be scaled up or down according to needs and technological availability. As an innovative module, it fosters accelerated development of production models related to glocal production and interconnected systems.
